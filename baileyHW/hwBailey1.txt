==================================================


The most similar intersperced repeat to consensus is an AluY @ chrY:13588-13730, with only 5.6% divergence. 
The most diverged interspersed repeat from the consensus is an L1MC4, a member of the line family, located @ chrY:90207-90318. However, as sequences become more distant, repeat masker has less information to identify them, and more divergent repeats may be present. 
There are a couple of full length repeats, including an ERV1 @ chrY:5667-6167 as determined by 0 bp left in reference repeat.
The sequence with the greatest percent of inserted bp's is an LTR/ERVL-MaLR located at chrY:11013-11343.  




Problem 2:
gorilla AluY alignment: gorilla.con.aln.1028
gorillaAlu.con.fa: is the gorilla consensus.  
My sequence is very similair to the consensus provided in the homework.  looking at a msa of the two, there are only two differences: The deletion of a bp in my sequence, and the shortening of the poly A tail. 



Problem 3:
The biggest tandem repeat is of "TAGGTCTCATTGAGGACAGATAGAGAGCAGACTGTGCAACCTTTAGAGTCTGCATTGGGCC" it has a period of 61,  305.4 copies, and a total lenth of 18629bp, making it the most significant tandem repeat all all three respective statistical measures.

Problem 4:
Tandem repeat finder only presents the full length sequence matching itself, while blast2seq presents multiple self hits, as well as a very informative dot plot. blast2_seq can determine tandem regions that are subjected to insertions or deletions.
